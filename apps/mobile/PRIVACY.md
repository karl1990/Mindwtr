# Privacy Policy for Mindwtr

**Last updated:** January 4, 2026

**Mindwtr** ("we", "our", or "us") is an open-source, local-first productivity application. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
**We do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data.**
* **Local Storage:** All data entered into Mindwtr (tasks, projects, notes) is stored locally on your device's internal storage or in a user-designated file (e.g., JSON/SQLite database).
* **No Hosted Cloud Sync:** Mindwtr does not run a hosted sync service. Supported sync backends are File Sync, WebDAV, and self-hosted sync. If you choose to sync via third-party providers (e.g., iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Syncthing), they work indirectly through File Sync and are subject to those providers' policies.

## 2. Third-Party Services
The application does not use third-party analytics services (like Google Analytics or Firebase) to track user behavior.

## 3. Crash Reporting
The application does not automatically send crash reports to external servers. Any logs generated are stored locally on your device for debugging purposes only.

## 4. Contact Us
