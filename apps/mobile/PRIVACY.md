# Privacy Policy for Mindwtr

**Last updated:** February 16, 2026

**Mindwtr** ("we", "our", or "us") is an open-source, local-first productivity application. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy.

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
We (the Mindwtr developer) do not operate analytics collection for user task content and do not run a hosted consumer cloud that stores your tasks by default.

* **Local Storage:** Data you create in Mindwtr (for example tasks, projects, notes, and settings) is stored locally on your device (SQLite/JSON).
* **No Hosted Mindwtr Consumer Sync:** Mindwtr does not provide a default hosted sync service. Supported sync backends are File Sync, WebDAV, and self-hosted sync. If you choose third-party storage/sync providers (for example iCloud Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive, Syncthing, or your own WebDAV server), data transmission is handled by your chosen provider and subject to their policies.

## 2. Third-Party Services
Mindwtr does not use third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics or Firebase) to track your in-app behavior.

## 3. Optional AI Features (BYOK)
Mindwtr provides optional AI assistant features using a **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** model.

* **What data is sent:** When you explicitly enable AI and use AI actions, the text you submit (for example task title, notes, and related prompt content) is sent to your selected provider for processing.
* **Who receives the data:** Your selected AI provider (for example OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Anthropic).
* **How data is sent:** Directly from your device to that provider using your API key.
* **User permission:** AI transmission only occurs after you enable AI and accept the in-app consent prompt.
* **Mindwtr developer access:** We do not proxy these AI requests, and we do not collect or store this AI request content.

## 4. Crash Reporting
The application does not automatically send crash reports to external servers. Any logs generated are stored locally on your device for debugging purposes only.
