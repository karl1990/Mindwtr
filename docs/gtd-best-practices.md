## The Core Philosophy

### Mind Like Water
The goal of GTD isn't just to be productive—it's to achieve **mental clarity**. When your mind is free from trying to remember what needs to be done, it can focus on actually doing things creatively and effectively.

> "Your head is for having ideas, not holding them." — David Allen

### The Five Steps
1. **Capture** — Get everything out of your head into a trusted system
2. **Clarify** — Decide what each thing means and what to do about it
3. **Organize** — Put things where they belong
4. **Reflect** — Review your system regularly
5. **Engage** — Take action with confidence

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Next Action

A next action is the **next visible, physical activity** you can do to move something forward. It's not a vague goal—it's a concrete action you could watch yourself doing.

**Bad examples:**
- "Work on project" ❌
- "Handle insurance" ❌
- "Make photo book" ❌

**Good examples:**
- "Open project folder and review status notes" ✓
- "Call insurance company at 1-800-XXX" ✓
- "Sort first 100 photos into 'keep' and 'discard' folders" ✓

> **Key Insight:** The next action often acts as a "bookmark" for where you left off. It should be small enough to start immediately, but meaningful enough to create momentum.

### 2. Projects vs. Tasks

A **project** is any outcome that requires more than one action to complete. It's not a to-do list—it's a commitment to a result.

**The project is NOT a list of steps.** Instead:
- The project folder holds all your planning, notes, and future ideas
- Your next actions list only shows what you can actually do right now
- When you complete a next action, decide the new one from your project notes

> **Community Wisdom:** "A project is a, well, project. It's something that you are working on consisting of potentially many actions. A next action is a small, actionable 'tickler' to work on."

### 3. Project Support Material

When you're planning a project and ideas flood in, **don't fight the flow**—capture everything. But don't put it all on your next actions list.

**Project support includes:**
- Future actions (not yet doable)
- Notes and research
- Reference materials
- Sub-outcomes and milestones
- Ideas you may never execute

> **Tip:** Keep this in your project folder, document, or notes. The next action list stays lean; project support holds everything else.

### 4. What to Do with "Not Yet" Actions

Actions that depend on other things being done first are **not next actions**—they're future actions.

**Where do they go?**
- In your project support material
- Tagged or noted as "waiting on X" or "after Y"
- Reviewed during your weekly review to promote when ready

> **The Weekly Review is where future actions become next actions.**

## Breaking Down Large Tasks

### The Chunking Principle

If a task takes more than 1-2 hours, it's probably too big. Break it down.

**Example: "Go through 5,000 photos for photo book"**

Instead of one massive task, create:
- "Review photos from January (folders 1-500)"
- "Review photos from February (folders 501-1000)"
- ...or "Spend 30 minutes sorting photos"

**Why it works:**
- Each chunk provides a sense of completion
- You can pick up where you left off without losing context
- Incremental wins keep motivation high (especially important for ADHD)

> **Time-boxing works:** "Spend 30 minutes on X" is a perfectly valid next action.

---

## Context Is Everything

### The Power of Contexts

Contexts help you see what you can do **right now** based on where you are, what tools you have, or who you're with.

**Traditional contexts:**
- @home, @work, @errands, @computer, @phone

**Energy-based contexts:**
- @low-energy, @high-focus, @creative, @admin

**Person-based contexts:**
- @Bob, @Sarah, @Team (for agenda items to discuss)

> **Pro Tip:** Tag tasks with the person's name (e.g., "+Michael" or "@Michael"). When that person calls unexpectedly, search for their name to see all open items.

### Surprise Interactions

When someone unexpectedly calls or stops by:
1. Search your system for their name
2. Review any agenda items or waiting-for items
3. Address what you can while you have their attention

> Build the muscle memory to check your system during every interaction.

## The Weekly Review

This is the **secret weapon** of GTD that most people skip.

### What It Includes:
1. **Collect loose ends** — Clear physical inbox, notes, emails
2. **Process everything** — Clarify and organize each item
3. **Review all lists** — Projects, next actions, waiting for, calendars
4. **Clean up** — Remove completed items, update stale ones
5. **Get current** — Make sure every project has a next action
6. **Look ahead** — Review upcoming calendar, upcoming projects

### How Long?
David Allen recommends **30-90 minutes every week**, ideally at the same time (Friday afternoon is popular).

> "If you genuinely zero out your inboxes, capture everything, clarify everything cleanly, and park it where it needs to go, then you should be seeing your entire inventory of work clearly."

### Splitting the Weekly Review

If a full weekly review feels overwhelming, split it into two sessions:

**Session 1: Friday afternoon (Get Clear)**
- Collect everything into your inboxes
- Process to zero
- Takes ~60 minutes

**Session 2: Saturday/Sunday morning (Get Current & Get Creative)**
- Review all projects and next actions
- Check calendar forward and back
- Review Someday/Maybe and higher horizons
- Takes ~60 minutes

> **Community Tip:** David Allen recommends a consistent environment: "Same time, same location, baroque music, dogs underfoot..."

## The Waiting-For List

### Managing Delegated Items

If you delegate a lot, your Waiting-For list can grow unwieldy. Here's how to manage it:

**Best Practices:**
- Set a follow-up date based on urgency when you delegate
- Use a tickler or reminder to resurface the item
- Tag items with the person's name for quick filtering
- Keep a "last contacted" date to track follow-up frequency

**Follow-Up Strategy:**
- For urgent items: Follow up within 1-2 days
- For normal items: Follow up weekly during your review
- For low-priority: Monthly reminder is sufficient

> **Mindset Shift:** It's not "nagging"—it's owning your work. You're simply reflecting back what they committed to do.

---

## Overcoming Resistance

### Why You Procrastinate on Tasks

GTD addresses resistance differently than other systems. Instead of fighting it with willpower:

1. **Clarify the next action** — Often procrastination means you haven't defined what "done" looks like or what the very next step is
2. **Make it smaller** — If you resist a task, break it into an even smaller step
3. **Remove the decision** — Pre-decide what to do so you just execute

> **The 2-Minute Rule:** If something takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. This plows through resistance.

### When Your Lists Feel Heavy

If looking at your lists drags you down:
- **Separate maintenance from momentum** — Keep chores grouped and knock them out in bursts
- **Connect to the why** — Remember why tasks matter
- **Prune aggressively** — If it's been sitting for weeks with no consequence, maybe it doesn't belong
- **Review higher horizons** — Are you drifting, or moving toward your goals?

---

## Multiple Next Actions?

### When It's Okay

You can have multiple next actions for a project when:
- They're truly parallel (no dependencies)
- Both can be done immediately
- Neither blocks the other

**Example:** For a vacation project:
- "Book flights" ✓
- "Request mail hold" ✓
- "Pack bags" ❌ (depends on when you leave)

### The "One True Next Action" Approach

Some practitioners prefer exactly one next action per project. This:
- Keeps lists lean
- Reduces decision fatigue
- Creates clear "bookmarks"

> Both approaches work. Pick what fits your style, but be consistent.

---

## The Sacred Calendar

### Calendar Is for Hard Landscape Only

GTD distinguishes between:
- **Hard landscape** — Appointments, deadlines, time-specific commitments
- **Soft landscape** — Tasks you'd like to do but aren't time-bound

**Don't put your next actions on the calendar** unless they truly must happen at that time.

### Time-Blocking Exception

David Allen does endorse **time-blocking** for complex work that needs focus. If a task needs 2+ hours of undistracted time, blocking a calendar slot can help.

> "The calendar is sacred territory. Only put actions there that MUST be completed at that time."

---

## Making GTD Stick

### The Learning Curve

**How long does it take?**
- **6 months** — To stop feeling clumsy with the system
- **1-2 years** — To truly internalize the principles
- **Ongoing** — Re-reading the book reveals new insights each time

> "It took me initially a couple of years to get some of the basics down. The biggest problem is mixing old habits with GTD."

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-engineering the system** — Keep it simple
2. **Skipping the weekly review** — This is where systems break down
3. **Making tasks too vague** — "Handle X" isn't actionable
4. **Trying to remember instead of capturing** — Write it down
5. **Not trusting the system** — If you don't trust it, you won't use it

---

## ADHD-Friendly Adaptations

For those with attention challenges:

1. **Write EVERYTHING down** — Don't rely on memory at all
2. **Use an app with quick capture** — Reduce friction to zero
3. **Break tasks into very small chunks** — Even "open the document" counts
4. **Track incremental progress** — Small wins maintain momentum
5. **Use visual organization** — Colors, emojis, kanban boards
6. **Keep lists clean** — Too many items creates overwhelm

> **Sequential tasks**: Some apps let you automatically surface the next action only when previous ones complete—great for ADHD brains.

---

## Work vs. Home Systems

### Should You Keep Them Separate?

Many GTD practitioners keep separate systems for work and personal life:

**Arguments for Separation:**
- Work stays at work; home stays at home
- Different tools may be required (corporate vs. personal)
- Reduces overwhelm by showing only relevant items

**Arguments for Unified:**
- One brain, one system
- Prevents things from falling through cracks
- Weekly review sees the whole picture

> **Practical Solution:** Many users keep separate lists within one system, or use IT-mandated tools (Outlook/To Do) for work and personal tools (Apple Reminders/Things) for home, then overlay calendars for unified view.

### Home Often Needs Different Treatment

At home, GTD can feel like more chores on top of chores. Strategies:
- Use paper for home tasks (less screen time)
- Have family members add to a shared inbox (physical box or app)
- Accept that some things won't get done—and that's okay

> "So what? I have a crappy garage. Who cares?" — David Allen

## When You're Overwhelmed

### The Horizons Model for Perspective

When you're buried under work, you don't need more action—you need **perspective**.

**The Solution: Go Up the Horizons**
1. Stop doing tasks
2. Look at your projects—why are you doing them?
3. Look at your Areas of Focus—what are you responsible for?
4. Look at your goals—what are you trying to achieve?
5. Look at your vision—what do you want your life to be?

> "If you need more Clarity, go up the Horizons. If you need more Action, move down the Horizons."

### Admin Days Before Big Projects

Before starting an intimidating project:
1. Block 1-2 days for "Admin"
2. Clear all inboxes completely
3. Bang out any nagging small tasks
4. Reschedule or delegate everything else
5. Take a rest day
6. Start the project fresh with full energy

---

## Higher Horizons of Focus

GTD isn't just about tasks. It's about alignment from the ground up:

| Level | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Ground** | Current actions |
| **Horizon 1** | Current projects |
| **Horizon 2** | Areas of focus & responsibility |
| **Horizon 3** | 1-2 year goals |
| **Horizon 4** | 3-5 year vision |
| **Horizon 5** | Life purpose & values |

When your lists feel meaningless, it often means you've **lost connection with the higher horizons**. Take time to review:
- What are my real goals?
- What do I want my life to look like?
- How does this task serve that vision?

## Quick Reference: The Clarify Checklist

For every item in your inbox, ask:

1. **What is it?**
2. **Is it actionable?**
   - No → Trash, Someday/Maybe, or Reference
   - Yes → Continue...
3. **What's the desired outcome?** (This is your project)
4. **What's the very next action?**
5. **Will it take less than 2 minutes?**
   - Yes → Do it now
   - No → Defer or delegate
6. **Add a context** (@home, @computer, @bob, etc.)
7. **Does it have a deadline?**
   - Yes → Add to calendar or add due date
   - No → It lives on your next actions list

## Focus GTD App Tips

Based on GTD principles, here's how to use Focus GTD effectively:

### Inbox
- **Capture quickly** — Don't think, just dump
- **Process to zero daily** — Clarify each item
- **Use 2-minute rule** — Quick actions get done immediately

### Next Actions
- **Filter by context** — See only what's relevant now
- **Keep descriptions concrete** — Start with a verb
- **Mark today's focus** — Pick 1-3 priorities each day

### Projects
- **Every project needs a next action** — If it's stalled, add one
- **Use checklists** — For multi-step workflows within tasks
- **Review weekly** — Ensure nothing is stuck

### Weekly Review
- **Schedule it** — Same day, same time each week
- **Clear inboxes** — Physical, digital, mental
- **Scan all projects** — Does each have a next action?
- **Update stale items** — Prune or defer what's not working

---

## The Mindset Shift

GTD isn't about doing more. It's about **doing the right things with less stress**.

The system works when:
- You trust it completely
- You capture everything
- You review regularly
- You keep it simple

> "Don't reinvent reality. Stay as true as you can to GTD. That makes a huge difference."
