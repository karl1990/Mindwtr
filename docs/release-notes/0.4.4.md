# Mindwtr 0.4.4

## Highlights
- Progressive disclosure in task editors (desktop + mobile) keeps the default form lean while still showing any fields you already filled in.
- Focus/Zen modes: desktop Focus Mode (hide sidebar, 800px reading width) and mobile Zen Mode (top 3 for Today).
- New core signals: fluid recurrence, procrastination (push) count, and project status states.

## Desktop
- Task editor now starts minimal and reveals advanced fields with “More options”.
- Task cards open in a read‑only view; press edit (or `e`) to enter edit mode.
- Focus Mode (Ctrl+\ / Cmd+\) hides sidebar and centers the list.
- Project status selector and sidebar grouping for Active vs Someday/Waiting.
- Agenda “Top 3 only” toggle now uses the visible agenda buckets.

## Mobile
- Task editor uses progressive disclosure with “More options”.
- Agenda Zen Mode shows only Today’s top 3 tasks and hides overdue.
- Quick capture keeps the input focused; help text is tucked behind a subtle toggle.

## Core
- Recurrence supports `strict` and `fluid` strategies.
- Task push count increments when due dates are rescheduled later.
- Project status states: `active`, `someday`, `waiting`, `archived`.

## Docs
- Updated documentation to reflect new editor behavior, Focus/Zen modes, and core fields.
