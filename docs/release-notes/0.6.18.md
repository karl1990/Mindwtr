# Mindwtr 0.6.18

## Highlights
- Fixed mobile UI noise by removing the stale `Conflicts resolved` sync banner.
- Kept heartbeat analytics fully silent for users on mobile while preserving daily heartbeat behavior in official builds.
- Standardized heartbeat endpoint wiring across non-FOSS Android, iOS, and desktop release pipelines.
- Improved release reliability for stores by fixing Winget dependency metadata and hardening iOS App Store editable-version handling.

## Mobile
- Suppressed stale sync success/error banner carry-over in mobile app startup flow.
- Enabled edge-to-edge defaults and removed deprecated status/navigation bar color overrides.
- Removed unused `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK` permission.
- Ensured heartbeat errors remain user-invisible and non-disruptive.

## Release / CI / Distribution
- Wired `ANALYTICS_HEARTBEAT_URL` from repository secrets in all non-FOSS release workflows.
- Removed Winget manifest injection of `Microsoft.EdgeWebView2Runtime` dependency to avoid missing-dependency validation failures.
- Updated iOS App Store upload automation to create/edit app versions safely when no editable version exists.
