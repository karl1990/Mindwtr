# Privacy Policy for Mindwtr

**Effective Date:** February 16, 2026

Mindwtr ("we", "our", or "us") is designed as a local-first application. We respect your privacy and aim to minimize data collection by design.

**1. Data Storage**
All data created within the app (tasks, projects, notes) is stored locally on your device.

**2. Data Sync**
If you choose to use sync features (e.g., File Sync, WebDAV, or self-hosted sync), your data is transmitted directly between your device and your chosen storage provider. We (the developer) do not have access to this data. Some providers (such as iCloud Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive) can work indirectly through File Sync.

**3. Third-Party Services (AI)**
If you use optional AI features with your own API key (BYOK):

- **What data is sent:** the text you submit for AI processing (for example task title/notes/prompt content).
- **Who receives it:** your selected provider (for example OpenAI, Google Gemini, or Anthropic).
- **When it is sent:** only after you enable AI and accept the in-app consent prompt.
- **How it is sent:** directly from your device to that provider.
- **Mindwtr developer access:** we do not proxy these requests and do not collect or store this AI request content.

**4. Contact Us**
